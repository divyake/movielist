# How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

It was already instructed to use Reactjs as the base for this project, I used custom css so that I can confidently work on the task provided and present a similarity to the screens shared.

# Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

Yes I can optimize the app for mobile devices more and am working on the same, since the project has to be completed within a time-frame I have provide with this app. I'll surely bootstrap my project to make it more responsive and easy to use.

# What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

I would have use used semantic-UI or bootstrap binched  with custom-css, and would have surely worked on improvising the user experience.
